# Learn Github Actions

This repo is created to learn about Github Actions.

The idea is to create a simple go server. When you hit the endpoint http://localhost:8080, it prints "Hello World".

The github action workflow will build this docker image and push it to a private docker hub.

## To Do

- [] Set up [self hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners), so that workflows are running on the self hosted runner instead
